PixelBox
========

PixelBox is an extension for [three.js](http://threejs.org), for rendering voxel sprites.

It includes base classes, a sprite and scene editor, and some examples.

PixelBox was originally developed to create [Santa Drop game for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/santa-drop-free/id948393987), and then expanded with extra tools and released as open source.
